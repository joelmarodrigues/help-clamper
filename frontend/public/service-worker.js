/**
 * Service Worker - Progressive Web App (PWA)
 * 
 * A Service Worker is a script that runs in the background, separate from the web page.
 * It enables features like:
 * - Offline functionality
 * - Caching strategies
 * - Background sync
 * - Push notifications
 * 
 * This service worker implements a hybrid caching strategy:
 * - Network-first for dynamic content (HTML, API responses)
 * - Cache-first for static assets (images, CSS, JS)
 * 
 * Learn more: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API

/**
 * Cache Configuration
 * 
 * CACHE: Unique cache name with version number
 * - Change version (v1 -> v2) to force cache invalidation
 * - Old caches are automatically deleted during 'activate' event
 * 
 * ASSETS: Files to cache immediately on installation
 * - Core files needed for offline functionality
 * - Must be available for the app to work offline

 * 3. Open cache storage
 * 4. Add all ASSETS to cache
 * 5. Installation completes
 * 
 * waitUntil: Ensures the service worker doesn't finish installing

 * Activate Event
 *

 * 4. Delete outdated caches
 * 5. Service worker takes control
 * 
 * This ensures users always get the latest version of cached content.

/**
 * Fetch Event - Caching Strategy
 * 
 * Intercepts all network requests and applies caching logic.
 * 
 * Strategy 1: Network-First (for HTML and JSON)
 * - Try to fetch from network
 * - If successful, update cache with fresh data
 * - If network fails, serve from cache (offline fallback)
 * - Best for dynamic content that changes frequently
 * 
 * Strategy 2: Cache-First (for static assets)
 * - Check cache first
 * - If found, return cached version immediately (fast!)
 * - If not in cache, fetch from network and cache it
 * - Best for images, CSS, JS that rarely change
 * 
 * Why this matters:
 * - Faster load times (serve from cache)
 * - Offline capability (fallback to cache)
 * - Fresh content when online (network-first for dynamic data)
